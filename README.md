# new_year
Silly, simple script to predict the luck for `$CURRENT_YEAR`.

## Usage
Add exec permissions to script and run:
~~~
chmod +x new_year.sh && ./new_year.sh
~~~

### Options
~~~
Usage: new_year.sh [-he]
  -h  help, show usage info
  -e  easy mode, increase odds of having a good year
  -d  discordian mode, use discordian year (ddate required)
~~~

It will hopefully return something like:
~~~
2022 will be a good year!
